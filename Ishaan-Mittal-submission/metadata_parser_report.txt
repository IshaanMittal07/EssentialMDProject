1. Accuracy of Extracted Data: 
- Patient Name: John Doe (as expected)
- Patient Health Card #: 1234567890AA (as expected)
- Date of Birth: March 07, 1985 (expected value: July 03, 1985).  
- Other extracted information: blood type, visit date, chief complaint 

2. Systematic issues: 
- Date of Birth format may vary depending on parser settings; could cause confusion (e.g. DD/MM/YYYY vs MM/DD/YYYY) <- root cause of inaccuracy for extracted DOB. 
- Parser assumes that the input format matches the test file; may fail on different formats. 
- No error handling for output; if the output path is incorrect or not writable, the parser might fail.
